Description: cmsr turns the incentive calculation into a very simple process
    that, after configuration and association to a target group, includes the
    incentive plan validation and simulation through what-if scenarios. This is
    completed, in order to determine the financial and sales potential impact before
    going to production (like weDo technology)
