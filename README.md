#cmsr

Commission management system **(cmsr)** 

cmsr turns the incentive calculation into a very simple process that, after configuration and association to a target group, includes the incentive plan validation and simulation through what-if scenarios. This is completed, in order to determine the financial and sales potential impact before going to production (like weDo technology)
